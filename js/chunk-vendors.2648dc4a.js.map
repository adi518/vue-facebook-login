For example, the CSS language definition\\n\\t\\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\\n\\t\\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\\n\\t\\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\\n\\t\\t * this:\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ```js\\n\\t\\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\\n\\t\\t *     // token\\n\\t\\t * };\\n\\t\\t * ```\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\\n\\t\\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ```js\\n\\t\\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\\n\\t\\t *     'style': {\\n\\t\\t *         // token\\n\\t\\t *     }\\n\\t\\t * });\\n\\t\\t * ```\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ## Special cases\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\\n\\t\\t * will be ignored.\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ```js\\n\\t\\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\\n\\t\\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\\n\\t\\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\\n\\t\\t * });\\n\\t\\t * ```\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ## Limitations\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\\n\\t\\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\\n\\t\\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\\n\\t\\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\\n\\t\\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\\n\\t\\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\\n\\t\\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * ```js\\n\\t\\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\\n\\t\\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\\n\\t\\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\\n\\t\\t * ```\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\\n\\t\\t * object to be modified.\\n\\t\\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\\n\\t\\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\\n\\t\\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\\n\\t\\t * object to be modified.\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\\n\\t\\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\\n\\t\\t * @public\\n\\t\\t */\\n\\t\\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\\n\\t\\t\\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\\n\\t\\t\\tvar grammar = root[inside];\\n\\t\\t\\t/** @type {Grammar} */\\n\\t\\t\\tvar ret = {};\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tfor (var token in grammar) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif (token == before) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.
